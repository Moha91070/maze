### Project Description:
A maze runner project with a Node, Maze, and Runner class, as well as a Solver script. Maze class stores maze start, end, wall, and floor spaces, and runner class evaluates free spaces and builds node paths between to solve it using a breadth first search. **The solver file can take in any type of maze.** As long as the maze has a uniqe start and end character, and is wrapped in wall characters the solver function can evaluate it as a maze an 'run' it. The solver script can take between 1 - 3 arguments. The first argument(s) is either a maze file to solve or a set of height and width, and  the last argument is an optional save file (default "completed.txt").
